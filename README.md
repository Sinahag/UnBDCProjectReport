## Abstract
Twitter has increasingly been the hub for people to obtain daily news and information, yet it is plagued with misinformation and fake news. 
During the coronavirus pandemic, information regarding the COVID-19 virus and health policies were constantly changing and it was difficult 
to differentiate between real or fake news. As such, this poses a serious health risk to society. Twitter has taken steps to combat this by 
utilizing machine learning to detect and delete misinformation, adding labels to misleading tweets and adding an exploration tab for accurate 
COVID-19 information. Our study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of these policies by looking at the frequency of COVID-19 vaccine 
misinformation before and after Twitter added these policies. As a proxy measure to quantify misinformation, we examined the tweet sentiment 
and subjectivity value, and found trends in common words and hashtags. In this preliminary study, we have found a general decreasing trend in 
misinformation after Twitter implemented these preventative measures suggesting that these policies are effective. Further study will need to 
confirm this as major assumptions in misinformation and sentiment value were made and various confounding variables may have affected the data. 
By studying Twitterâ€™s misinformation policy during COVID-19, we hope other social media companies will continue to combat misinformation.
